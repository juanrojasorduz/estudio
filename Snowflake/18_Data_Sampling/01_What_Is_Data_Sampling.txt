### Data Sampling
Instead of querying on the complete database, we would take a random sample out of this database and then just use
this sample to develop, to reduce compute costs.

-Use-cases: Query development,data analysis
-Faster & more cost efficient (less compute resources)


### Data Sampling Methods

** Row or Bernoulli method
Every row is chosen with percentage p
More "randomness"
Smaller tables

** Block or System method
Every block "micro partitions" is chosen with percentage p
More effective processing
Larger tables
