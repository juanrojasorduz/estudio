2-Query Processing	
Virtual Warehouse	
"Muscle of the system"									
It is where the queries are processed									
It is where the virtual warehouse has come into play									
Performs MMP (Massive Parallel Processing)	
Very efficient in processing our queries								
Queries can be processed by multiple servers at the same time								
It is the virtual compute resource we can use to process all of our queries and all of the operations									
												
												
3-Storage
Hybrid Columnar Storage										
Data is stored and compressed into blobs										
												
												
#### VIRTUAL WAREHOUSE SIZE											
are virtual compute instances of servers we can use to process the queries on our data										
we can increase or decrease the warehouse size in order to process more eficiently the queries on our data										
												
												
Size specifies the amount of compute resources available per cluster in a warehouse.										
XS	1 server	Ideally for queries not complex									
S	2 servers	One credit consumed per hour									
M	4 servers	If we run it for 30 minutes or is active for 30 minutes, We only have of a credit consumed									
L	8 servers										
XL	16 servers										
4XL	128 servers										
												
If there are multiple query executions and the warehouse cannot process them the queries will be proccessed in queue											
												
Multiclustering											
Multi-cluster warehouses enable you to scale compute resources to manage your user and query concurrency needs as they change, such as during peak and off hours.										
												
Executing a Query											
Select the appropiated role accoding to query 										
Select the warehouse that will be used to execute the query										
Select the database that will be used										
												
For creating or manipulate warehouses is neccesary to have the following roles											
SYSADMIN										
SECURITYADMIN										
ACCOUNTADMIN										
												
												
AutoScaling - They have a different time to start a new cluster									

*********Scaling Policy 										
**Standard (Default) 
-Favors starting additional warehouses	
	Prevents/minimizes queuing by faboring starting additional clusters over conserving credits	
-Cluster Starts:Inmediately when either a query is queued or the system detects that there are more queries than can be executed by the currently available clusters	
-Cluster Shuts Down: "After 2 to 3 consecutive successful checks
	(Performed at minute intervals)
	which determine whether the load on the least-loaded cluster could be redistributed to the other clusters"								

**Economy
-Favors conserving credits rather than starting additional warehouses"	
	"Conserves credits by favoring keeping running clusters fully-loaded rather than starting additional clusters.
	Result: May result in queries being queued and taking longer to complete"	
-Cluster Starts: Only if the system estimates there's enough query load to keep the cluster busy for at least 6 minutes	
-Cluster Shuts Down: After 5 to 6 consecutive succesful checks
