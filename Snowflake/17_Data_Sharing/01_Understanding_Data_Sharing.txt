## Data sharing
- Usually this can be also a rather complicated process
- Data Sharing without actual copy of the data & uptodate
-Usually we would take physically a copy of the data and then if there are some changes, we need to extract the data and update the data
-Similar to the cloning, we can share data without actually taking a copy of the data
-Data sharing will be just enabling a consumption of the data that is always up to date and inmediatelly up to date
-Shared data can be consumed by the own compute resources, so own compute resources of the one that is consuming this data
-Non-snowflake-users can also access through a reader account


## There are two ways to share data

- Query Statements
- Interface
