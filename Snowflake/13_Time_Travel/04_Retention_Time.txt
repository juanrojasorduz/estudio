**We can see hom many days of retention time have a table after being created using this query:

SHOW TABLES

**We can alter the days for retention using this command:

ALTER TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.CUSTOMERS
SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 2;

This changes the default value which is 1


**We can set the retention time when creating the table, for example:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE OUR_FIRST_DB.PUBLIC.ret_example (
	id int,
	first_name string,
	phone string
        )
	DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 3;


If retention time is 0 we cannot do time travel and undrop
