### Access Control

* Who can access and perform operations on objects in snowflake
* Two aspects of access control combined:

1) Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
-Each object has an owner who can grant access to that object

2) Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
-Access privileges are assigned to roles, which are in turn assigned to users


* Every object owned by a single role (multiple users)
* Owner (role) has all privileges per default



USER => People or systems
ROLE => Entity to which privileges are granted (role hierarchy)
PRIVILEGE => Level of access to an object (SELECT, DROP, CREATE etc)
SECURABLE OBJECT => Objects to which privileges can be granted (Database, Table, Warehouse etc)



### Roles Overview

There are 5 system defined roles:
1) ACCOUNTADMIN
	- SYSADMIN AND SECURITYADMIN
	- top-level role in the system
	- should be granted only to a limited number of users
2) SECURITYADMIN
	- USERADMIN role is granted to SECURITYADMIN 
	- Can Manage users and roles
	- Can Manage any object grant globally 
3) SYSADMIN
	- Create warehouses and databases (and more objects)
	- Recommended that all custom roles are assigned
4) USERADMIN
	- Dedicated to user and role management only
	- Can create users and roles
5) PUBLIC
	- Automatically granted to every user
	- Can create own objects like every other role (available to every other user/role)


####### ACCOUNTADMIN
Top-Level-Role
- Manage & View all objects
- All configurations on account level
- Account operations (create reader account)

- First user will have this role assigned
- The purpose of this object is do initial setup & managing account level objects

** Best practices
- Very controlled assignment strongly recommended!
- Use multifactor authentication
- At least two users should be assigned to that role
- Avoid creating objects with that role unless you have to


####### SECURUTYADMIN
- Account admin tab
- Create & manage users and roles
- Grant and revoke privileges to roles

####### SYSADMIN
- Create and manage objects
- Create and manage warehouses, databases, tables etc.
- Custom roles should be assigned to the SYSADMIN role as the parent

Then this role also has the ability to grant privileges on warehouses, databases, 
and other objects to the custom roles.

####### USERADMIN
- Create Users & Roles (User & Role Management)
- Not for granting privileges (only the one that is owns)


###### PUBLIC
- Least privileged role (bottom of hierarchy)
- Every user is automatically assgined to his role
- Can own objects
- These objects are then available to everyone


####### Custom roles
- Customize roles to our needs and create own hierarchies
- Custom roles are usually created by SECURITYADMIN
- Should be leading up to the SYSADMIN role
