###### What is a Snowpipe?

Enables automatically loading data once a file appears in a bucket
When a new file is added to that bucket, we can automatically don't have to do anything
But automatically this file is loaded into the given table
This feature is great If data needs to be available immediately for analysis
Snowpipe uses serverless features instead of warehouses, so compute resources will be automatically managed by snowflake itself

We have here this snowpipe created which serverless loads the data in our table once the notification that there is a new file in
our bucket has been received by the snowpipe

### High Level Steps
1) Create Stage (To have the connection)
2) Test COPY COMMAND (To make sure it works)
Location to the external stage that we want to copy data from
3) Create Pipe (Create pipe as object with COPY COMMAND)
Contains copy command definition
4) S3 Notification (To trigger snowpipe)
We should set up an event notification
This event is just telling the pipe that there is a new object in this bucket and that it can start loading these files

We are Ready, the pipe will be working!!
