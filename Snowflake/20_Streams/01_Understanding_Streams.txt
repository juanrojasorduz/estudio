### What are the streams?
- Object that records (DML-) changes made to a table
- This process is called change data capture (CDC)

                    TABLE
		    ________
		   |__|__|__|  DELETE	
Stream Object ===> |__|__|__|  INSERT
		   |__|__|__|  UPDATE


The changes in that table are captured and include operations like DELETE,INSERT,UPDATE statements
The stream object will capture these rows that have been updated,inserted or deleted
Additional to the columns that has the target table, there are three more columns for metadata which are:

- METADATA$ACTION
- METADATA$UPDATE
- METADATA$ROW_ID

That metadata will be then telling us whether this data has been updated,inserted or deleted
The storage will not increase for stream object because is just retrieved from the original table



CREATE STREAM <stream name>
 ON TABLE <table name>

SELECT * FROM <stream name>

We can directly query from this stream
