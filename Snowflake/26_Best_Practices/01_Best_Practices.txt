#### BEST PRACTICES TO USE SNOWFLAKE AND REDUCE COSTS:

****** Virtual Warehouses
-Enable Auto-Suspend => AUTO_SUSPEND = 600 (Seconds) 
-Enable Auto-Resume => AUTO_RESUME = TRUE 
-Set appropiate timeouts
-Choose the appropiate size for the warehouse


****** Table design
-Choose an appropiate table type
	- Staging tables - Use Transient
	- Productive tables - Use Permanent
	- Development tables - Use Transient
-Choose an appropiate data type
	- For snowflake Varchar = Varchar(N)
-Set cluster keys only if neccesary just for large tables
	-Most query time for table scan
-Using dimensions


****** Monitoring (Use the ACCOUNT ADMIN)
-- Table Storage

SELECT * FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS";

-- How much is queried in databases
SELECT * FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."QUERY_HISTORY";

SELECT 
DATABASE_NAME,
COUNT(*) AS NUMBER_OF_QUERIES,
SUM(CREDITS_USED_CLOUD_SERVICES)
FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."QUERY_HISTORY"
GROUP BY DATABASE_NAME;


-- Usage of credits by warehouses
SELECT * FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY";

-- Usage of credits by warehouses // Grouped by day
SELECT 
DATE(START_TIME),
SUM(CREDITS_USED)
FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY"
GROUP BY DATE(START_TIME);

-- Usage of credits by warehouses // Grouped by warehouse
SELECT
WAREHOUSE_NAME,
SUM(CREDITS_USED)
FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY"
GROUP BY WAREHOUSE_NAME;

-- Usage of credits by warehouses // Grouped by warehouse & day
SELECT
DATE(START_TIME),
WAREHOUSE_NAME,
SUM(CREDITS_USED)
FROM "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY"
GROUP BY WAREHOUSE_NAME,DATE(START_TIME);



****** Retention period
-Staging database - 0 days (transient)
-Production - (4-7) days (1 day min)
-Large high-churn tables-0 days (transient)
