###### Snowflake Pricing

Snowflake has decoupled the compute from the storage.

Pay only what you need
Scalable amout of storage at affordable cloud price
Pricing depending on the region
Compute and storage costs decoupled

***Storage
- Monthly storage fees
- Based on average storage used per month
- Cost calculated after compression
- Cloud providers


***Compute
- Charged for active warehouses per hour
- Depending on the size of the warehouse
- Billed by second (minumum of 1min)
- Charged in Snowflake credits


We are charged in the so-called snowflake credits
$/Euros  =====> Snowflake Credits

The these credits are consumed depending on what we are using

Depending of the snowflake edition we select the credit cost changes, for example:

- Standard: $2/Credit
- Enterprise: $3/Credit
- Business Critical: $4/Credit
- Virtual Private: Contact Snowflake


This cost can changes according to the region we have selected and also the platform 

If we have larger warehouses, the consumption of the credit per time goes up

For storage is the same, we pay for the storage we use and the price changes according to the region we selected

**On demand storage
-Pay only for what you use
-$45/TB

**Capacity storage
-Pay only for defined capacity upfront
-$24.50/TB



### Monitor Usage

To monitor the credit use: 

1) select the ACCOUNTADMIN role
2) go to snowflake account
3) go to admin
4) select the warehouse we want to monitorize
5) select if you want to monitor the compute or storage usage
