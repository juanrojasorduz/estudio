To load Unstructured data there are some steps we need to follow:

1) Create Stage => To connect to the location where the file is stored
2) Load raw data => Load the raw data into a separate table (Just one Column with a special data type "VARIANT")
3) Analyse & Parse => Apply snowflake functions to analyse a parse  
4) Flatten & Load => If this data is hierarchical we need to flatten this data

Note: Data parsing is a method where one string of data gets converted into a different type of data

**For example we can have this JSON:

{
	"city": "Grinmshaw",
	"first_name": "Richi",
	"gender": "Female",
	"id": 1
}

We have four atributes (city,first_name,gender,id) and also the values for those atributes like for example "Female" for gender

**For multiple objects it would be:

{"city": "Grinmshaw","first_name": "Richi","gender": "Female","id": 1},
{"city": "Cali","first_name": "Juan","gender": "Male","id": 2},
{"city": "Bogota","first_name": "Maria","gender": "Female","id": 3}


**We can also have this case this case in which there are nested data and arrays:
{
	"city": "Grinmshaw",
	"first_name": "Richi",
	"gender": "Female",
	"id": 1,
	"prev_company": ["Witting LLC","Kessler","Bailey and Berge"]
	"job": {
		"salary": 15200,
		"title": "Accounting Assitant II"
		},
	"last_name": "Kinningley",
	"spoken_languajes": [
		{"languaje":"Kashmiri","level":"Advanced"},
		{"languaje":"Punjabi","level":"Basic"}
			    ]
}
