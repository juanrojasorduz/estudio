#### Stages
Not to be confused with datawarehouses stages
Database object that contains the location of data files where data can be loaded from 

*External Stage
- External cloud provider
- S3
- Google cloud plattform  (blob storage)
- Microsoft Azure (blob storage)
- Database object created in schema
- CREATE STAGE (URL, access settings)
Note: Additional costs may apply if region/platform differs
External stages store the files in an external location (i.e. S3 bucket) that is referenced by the stage. 
An external stage specifies location and credential information, if required, for the S3 bucket.

*Internal Stage
Internal stages store the files internally within Snowflake
Local storage maintained by snowflake
