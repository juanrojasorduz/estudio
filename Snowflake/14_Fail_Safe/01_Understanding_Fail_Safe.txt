Another component that is also part of the data protection lifecycle in Snowflake

So the purpose of fail safe is that it serves as a data protection of our data in case of a disaster

### Fail Safe
* Protection of historical data in case of disaster
* We get a non configurable seven day period for permanent tables
* Period starts immediately after time travel periods ends
* So once this time travel period has endend, this table gets moved into this failsafe area
* Its important to say that we cannot restore this data by ourselves, but we have to contact snowflake
* We cannot query this data directly
* This feature contributes to storage cost

Access and query data     Undrop		 No user operations/queries
		          Select.. at before	 Recovery beyond time travel
						 Restoring only by snowflake support
	 
current data storage   >> time travel         >> Fail Safe
			  (0-90 days)		 transient: 0 days
						 permanent: 7 days
