### Materialized Views
- We have a view that is queried frequently and take a long time to be processed
- We can create a materialized view to solve that problem
- Use any select-statement to create this MV
- Results will be stored in a separate table and this will be updated automatically based on the base table


### When to use MV?
View would take a long time to be processed and is used frequently
Underlaying data is change not frequently and on a rather irregular basis
If the data is updated on a very regular basis using tasks & streams could be a better alternative

Don't use materialized view if data changes are very frequent
Keep maintenance cost in mind
Consider leveraging tasks & streams instead
