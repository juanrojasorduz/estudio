##### ZERO COPY Cloning

This enables us to easily create copies of database, schemas, tables and other objects
We would have to copy the complete structure, all of the metadata, the primary keys and everything, we can do it with a simple clone command

clone command => metadata operation => Referencing all the metadata of the original table => We do not additional cost in terms of our storage
											  => The cost only increases if we have data updated or changed



* Cloned object is independent from original table

* Easy to copy all meta data & improved storage management

* Creating backups for development purposes

* Works with time travel also


COMMAND:

CREATE TABLE <name>
	CLONE <source_table_name>
	

For time travel:

CREATE TABLE <name>
	CLONE <source_table_name>
	BEFORE ( TIMESTAMP => <timestamp> )


###### ADDITIONAL RULES

- Any structure of the object and meta data is inherited:
	including clustering keys, comments etc
- Is available to clone Data Storage Objects (Permanent and transient):
	- Databases
	- Schemas
	- Tables
- Its posible to clone other Configuration objects like:
	- Stages
	- File Formats
	- Tasks
