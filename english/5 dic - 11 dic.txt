I yearn for a better team in this season, because the championship that played out last season show us that there is not enough commitment from the team players, they didn’t have the courage to win. The other team was an undisputed champion.
As with better teams England is playing out a great season this year, his great football has lingered for many years, the don’t have a boundary to win 
I feel that Hans Flick has a big remorse because he didn´t call to Toni Kross for the world cup, perhaps he thought that Toni was too elderly and not playing out a great season to call him but although this he has a great experience.
