SAS

Type of Steps:

*Data: A data step generally reads data from an input source,processes it, and creates a SAS table. 
A data step might also filter rows,compute new columns,join tables, and perform other data manipulations 

For this program the Data step is creating an output table and adding a new column:
data myclass: 
    set sashelp.class;
    heightcm=height*2.54;
run;
	


*Proc (Procedure): A PROC,or procedure step processes a SAS TABLE in an specific,predefined way.
	For example to generate reports and graphs,manage data,or perform complex statistical analyses

For this program the proc print step generates a list of all the rows and columns in the data

proc print data=myclass;
run;

For this program the proc means step calculates basic summary statistics:

proc means data=myclass;
    var age heightcm;
run;


Each step consists of a sequence of statements 
Most statements start with a keyword that's part of the SAS language 



STEP #1 - KEYWORDS: data,set,run
data myclass: STATEMENT #1
    set sashelp.class; STATEMENT #2
    heightcm=height*2.54; STATEMENT #3
run; STATEMENT #4

STEP #2 - KEYWORDS: proc,print,run
proc print data=myclass; STATEMENT #1
run; STATEMENT #2

STEP #3 - KEYWORDS: proc,means,var,run
proc means data=myclass; STATEMENT #1
    var age heightcm; STATEMENT #2
run; STATEMENT #3
