The Kubernetes executor and the KubernetesPodOperaor dynamically launch and terminate Pods to run Airflow tasks.

Both can use the Kubernetes API to create Pods for running tasks.

Differences:
#### KubernetesPodOperator
Requires a Docker image
Defines one task (others don't have to run in Pods)
Higher abstraction, easier to config
Can run any valid Docker image
Better control over the environment in which the task runs


#### KubernetesExecutor
Does not require a Docker image
Applies to all tasks (all tasks run in their own Pod)
Less abstraction, harder to config (executor_config argument)
Custom Docker images must have Airflow installed
Better control over the resource utilization across tasks


It's common to use both in the same Airflow environment, where all tasks need to run on Kubernetes, but only some tasks require additional environment configurations (handled by the KPO)
