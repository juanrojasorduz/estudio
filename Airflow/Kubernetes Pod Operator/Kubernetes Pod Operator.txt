Kubernetes Pod Operator

Runs a Docker image in a dedicated Kubernetes POD

What is the Kubernetes Pod Operator
as you are going to see it is simple

Basically, the Kubernetes Pod Operator allows you to run a docker image in a dedicated
Kubernetes Pod 
It means that the Kubernetes Pod Operator launches its own task in a Kubernetes Pod with
its own configuration

Concretely, if you want to run a task in another language, or if you want to run a task
with different resources or if you want to attach a specific configuration to that task,
you can do that. Because the task runs in isolated Kubernetes Pod and it doesn't impact your
airflow instance, or the other tasks that are running

That is why the Kubernetes Pod Operator is so useful

You have one Kubernetes cluster and the kpo

In the case of you have your airflow instance running inside the Kubernetes cluster. In that case the KPO will be
in the Kubernetes cluster on the right.

but in this case, we have the airflow instance on one side and the kubernetes cluster on the other side.

That said, when the KPO runs, that triggers a Kubernetes Pod in the Kubernetes cluster with the docker image
corresponding to the task.

So obviously you need to have a Kubernetes cluster and you need to install the following provider to access the
Kubernetes Pod operator
