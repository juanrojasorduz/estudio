Now it's time to build a Docker image based on that docker file in order to use it in the 
Kubernetes Pod operator.

### make sure that you are at the root of your astro project (kpo).Then:
cd simple_app
docker build -t localhost:5000/simple_app .


### publish that docker image into the local docker registry so that image is accessible by
the Kubernetes Pod Operator.
docker push localhost:5000/simple_app
